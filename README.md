## ✨ Key Features

### 🌌 1. 4K Ultra-HD 3D Cosmic Milky Galaxy Simulation
- **260,000 High-Definition Stardust Particles**: Generated via Box-Muller Gaussian mathematics mimicking natural spiral galaxy arm distribution.
- **Ultra-HD Particle Engine**: Custom 256×256 radial gradient stardust sprite with hardware trilinear mipmapping (LinearMipmapLinearFilter) and device pixel ratios up to 3.0 for razor-sharp 4K rendering.
- **Cinematic 4-Beat Detonation Sequence**:
  1. *Singularity Inception*: Breathing cosmic seed pulses at the core.
  2. *Ballistic Shockwave Burst*: Dynamic camera recoil and screen rumble as cosmic dust detonates outwards.
  3. *Accretion Vortex Swirl*: Gravitational pull draws particles into dual sweeping logarithmic spiral arms.
  4. *Continuous 3D Parallax*: Responsive mouse-following perspective tilt with smooth damping and continuous rotational drift.
- **Pure Pitch-Black Canvas (#000000)**: Zero light leakage or ambient occlusion, producing authentic astronomical contrast.

### 💎 2. High-Contrast Starlight White & Platinum Silver UI
- Complete elimination of muddy purple-blue hues in favor of crisp **Diamond Starlight White (#ffffff)** and **Platinum Silver (#cbd5e1)**.
- Translucent obsidian glass cards with starlight borders (
gba(255, 255, 255, 0.15)).
- Radiant hover states, pill chips, and glow lighting synced directly with the background cosmic particle engine.

### ⚡ 3. Dynamic Event Ecosystem
- **Zero-Dependency Vanilla JS Engine**: Fast, lightweight performance without bloated frameworks or build steps.
- **Live Search & Category Filtering**: Instantly search across Hackathons, Workshops, Competitions, and Seminars.
- **Dynamic Event Details Page**: Clean query-parameter routing (pages/event-details.html?id=<event-id>) that renders schedules, guidelines, eligibility, team size, and interactive FAQ accordions.
- **Interactive Registration Modal**: Built-in modal forms with validation and success states.
